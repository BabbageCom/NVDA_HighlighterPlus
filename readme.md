# NVDA Highlighter Plus #

This addon is a copy of the NVDA Highlighter functionality and is a proof of concept to improve the current NVDA Highlighter.
Current improvements are:
* the highlighter checks the position of the to-be-followed objects regularly and updates the rectangles. 

## Known problems
* the highlighter can only be started once. If the users tries to turn off and turn on the highlighter an unknown error occurs.
